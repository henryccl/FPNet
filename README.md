# FP-Net: 

This repository is the official **PyTorch** implementation of FPNet.

## Overview

Coming soon！

## Requirements
All experiments use the PyTorch library. We conducted training and validation on a workstation with a GTX 3080, using Ubuntu 20.04 as the operating system. We recommend installing the following package versions:

* &nbsp;&nbsp; python=3.7 

* &nbsp;&nbsp; pytorch=1.10.0

## Comparison of experimental details
SRNet：We used [SRNet](https://github.com/brijeshiitg/Pytorch-implementation-of-SRNet)
 that can achieve 89.43% on S-Uniward 0.4bpp on V100 for SRNet experiments.
